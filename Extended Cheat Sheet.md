# EXTENDED MARK DOWN CHEAT SHEET

Here's an extended markdown cheat sheet for referring extra Markdown syntax which you may find handy.
For each command, I have given an example of how the command will be shown along with the syntax which will be mentioned next to it in ` Code block `

***

> ESCAPE FORMATTING CHARACTERS: 

If you wish to show a formatting character, put a backslash ` \ ` before the character you want to show. These characters may be characters that will help formatting in markdown but you wish to display them. In such a case, you can display them mentioning the backslash ` \ ` before the character.

\* Hi ! \*    |   `  \* Hi ! \* ` 

``` 

CHARACTERS THAT ACCEPT BACKSLASH:

\   backslash
`   tickmark
*   asterisk
_   underscore 
{}  curly braces 
[]  brackets
()  parentheses
#   pound sign
+   plus sign
-   minus sign (hyphen) 
.   dot
!   exclamation mark

```
